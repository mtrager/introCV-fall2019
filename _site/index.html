<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Four/five programming assignments (60% of the grade) + final project (40% of the
grade).</p>

<!-- 
__Assignments:__ There will be four/five programming assignments representing
60% of the grade. The supporting materials for the programming assignments
projects will be in Python.

__Final project:__ The final project will represent 40% of the grade. Each
project is based on a paper and a list of suggested papers is available here.
Feel free to ask for papers on a topic that you are interested in or propose a
paper. You are expected to understand and present the paper, but also to offer
some added value, such as experiments of your own, new interesting tests with
available code, or comparison with other relevant works. This will have to be
adapted depending on the paper. You will have to present your project (10
minutes + questions) and return a summary (2 pages max) of the essential points
that should be readable (and useful) for the other students in the class. -->

<!-- __Collaboration policy:__ You can discuss the assignments and final projects
with other students in the class. Discussions are encouraged and are an
essential component of the academic environment. However, each student has to
work out their assignment alone (including any coding, experiments or
derivations) and submit their own report. The assignments and final projects
will be checked to contain original material. -->

### Lab sessions / Parallel Curricula

### DistributionalRL: [Living document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bk6txed3bjvPBsWF26HD4xab-iUylHtA7vGXfP4QFew/edit?usp=sharing)

* Class 1: Basics of RL and Q learning
  * Required Reading:
    * [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf) (Ch 3, Ch 4, Ch 5, Ch 6.5)
      * The standard introduction to RL.  Focus in Chapter 3 on getting used to the notation we’ll use throughout the module, and an introduction to the Bellman operator and fixed point equations.  In Chapter 4 the most important idea is value iteration (and exercise 4.10 will ask you to show why iterating the Q function is basically the same algorithm).
      * Chapter 5 considers using full rollouts to estimate our value / Q function, rather than the DP updates.  Focus on the difference between on-policy and off-policy, which will be relevant to the final algorithm.
      * Including 6.5 is an introduction to Q-learning in practice, updating one state-action pair at a time (without worrying about function approximation yet).
    * [Contraction Mapping Theorem](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/book/ch3.pdf) (3.1)
      * We’ll need the notion of contractions repeatedly throughout the module.  Their essential property is a unique fixed point, and you should have a clear understanding of the constructive proof of this fixed point (don’t worry about the ODE applications).
  * Questions:
    * Exercise 3.14, Exercise 4.10 in S & B
    * Prove the Bellman operator contracts Q functions with regard to the infinity norm
    * What is a sanity-check lower bound on complexity for Q learning?  Why might this be infeasible for RL problems in the wild?


### NeuralODE: [Living document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GHvyCCZ3Ep-IWa5QSQ6NMtPsCJry9h0jOPues5iEIus/edit?usp=sharing)

* Class 5: The adjoint method (and auto-diff)
  * Motivation: The adjoint method is a numerical method for efficiently computing the gradient of a function in numerical optimization problems.

We also review the basics of Automatic Differentiation, which will help us understand the efficiency of the algorithm proposed in the NeuralODE paper.

    * How do you get eq. (14) in Section 8.7 of CSE?


* Class 4: Normalizing Flow

    * [High-Dimensional Probability Estimation with Deep Density Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.5125.pdf)
  * Questions:
    * In DE, what is the difference between t and t, i.e. what do they represent?
    * In DE, why does eq. (4.2) imply convergence t   as t ?
    * What is the computational complexity of evaluating a determinant of a N x N matrix, and why is that relevant in this context?

    * Invertible ResNets: [The Reversible Residual Network: Backpropagation Without Storing Activations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04585.pdf)
    * [Stable Architectures for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03341.pdf)
  * Questions:
    * Can you think of any other neural network architectures which can be seen as discretizations of some ODE?
    * Do you understand why adding ‘residual layers’ should not degrade the network performance?
    * How do the authors of (Multi-level […]) explain the phenomena of still having almost as good performances in residual networks when removing a layer?
    * Implement your favourite variant ResNet variant

* Class 2: Numerical solution of ODEs II

  * Questions:
    * From NA, Section 12: Exercises 12.11, 12.12, 12.19


* Class 1: Numerical solution of ODEs I

    simulations is one of the main topics in numerical analysis and of fundamental importance in applied sciences. 
  * Required Reading: 
    * Sections 12.1-4 from [An Introduction to Numerical Analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-introduction-to-numerical-analysis/FD8BCAD7FE68002E2179DFF68B8B7237#) (NA) or Sections 11.1-3 from [Numerical Mathematics](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540346586?token=holiday18&utm_campaign=3_fjp8312_us_dsa_springer_holiday18&gclid=Cj0KCQiAvebhBRD5ARIsAIQUmnlViB7VsUn-2tABSAhIvYaJgSEqmJXD7F4A7EgyDQtY9v_GeUsNif8aArGAEALw_wcB) (NM)

      Assuming sufficient smoothness of y and f, for what value of 0 <= theta <= 1 is 
      the truncation error the smallest? What does this mean about the accuracy of
